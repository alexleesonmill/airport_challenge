Method
-------
* I spent a bit of time early in the exercise considering whether the majority of the methods should be in the Plane class or the Airport class. It felt more natural to have the in the airport class but that does cause it's own issues and I ran out of time to see if those issues would be corrected by switching it round. 

* I tried to keep it as simple as possible. I think my code is relatively simple, however i still feel like my tests are long and require too much setup. I'm sure this would be somewhat corrected with the use of doubles. 


Issues I think still exist with my program
---------
* I haven't used doubles in my tests so they are quite long
* It will take a plane off even if I use a different variable than the one that was called so planes aren't tagged
* I need to test for multiple planes landing
* I haven't utilised a separate class for the weather
